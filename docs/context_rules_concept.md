<!--
PURPOSE
  This document defines deterministic rules for any AI agent regarding:
  - saving the “active context” of current tasks,
  - updating/synchronizing that context during work,
  - maintaining references to plans and related artifacts.

SCOPE
  These rules apply to all chat sessions in this repository.
-->

# Rules for saving and updating active task context

## 1) Definitions

- **Active context** — the minimal but sufficient task state that allows another AI to resume work in a new chat without guessing.
- **Current task** — the primary task the agent is working on in this chat right now.
- **Task plan** — a separate artifact (a file in `ai_memory/` or `docs/`, or a plan in `manage_todo_list`) that contains execution steps.
- **Context synchronization** — bringing `ai_memory/active_context.md` into alignment with the actual state of the current chat.
- **Breadcrumbs** — short “resume hints” that make it possible to jump back into the work quickly (what was last touched, what to search for, and where to go next). Breadcrumbs should survive small repo drift between sessions.
- **Guardrails** — explicit constraints that must not be violated while working (invariants, forbidden changes, risk hotspots, temporary allowances, and definition of done).

## 2) Sources of truth and files

### 2.1. Where active context is stored

- Active context is stored in `ai_memory/active_context.md`.
- `ai_memory/active_context.md` is the **only** “startup” file that must be sufficient to resume work.

### 2.2. Where plans are stored

- A task plan may be stored:
  - in files under `ai_memory/` (e.g., `ai_memory/*_plan.md`, `ai_memory/*_ctx.md`), or
  - in files under `docs/` (if the plan/spec is part of documentation), or
  - in the internal plan of the `manage_todo_list` tool.

**Mandatory:** references/pointers to all relevant plan files or artifacts must be listed in `ai_memory/active_context.md`.

## 3) New chat startup rules

1) At the start of every new chat, the agent **must always** load and follow `ai_memory/active_context.md` without additional reminders.
2) If `ai_memory/active_context.md` is empty or stale, the agent must:
	- record this as a risk/blocker in the chat,
	- reconstruct context from artifacts (if known),
	- and update `ai_memory/active_context.md` to the current state.

3) If `ai_memory/active_context.md` contains multiple tasks from a previous chat/session:
	- If the new chat intent matches **any** `task_id` described in the active context (Current Task or Other Tasks), reuse the existing active context and sync under the matching task.
	- If the new chat intent does **not** match any described task, the agent must perform a context switch (see `docs/context_rules/switching.md`).
	  In that switch, tasks in the previous active context must be archived **separately by task_id** so none of them are lost.

## 4) Minimal active context structure (mandatory template)

`ai_memory/active_context.md` **must** contain the following sections in the given order (so other AIs can parse/validate unambiguously).

**Section classification:**
- 🔴 **MANDATORY** (1–4): Must always be present and filled.
- 🟡 **RECOMMENDED** (5–6): Should be present for non-trivial tasks.
- 🟢 **OPTIONAL** (7–24): Use when relevant; skip if not applicable.

---

### 🔴 MANDATORY SECTIONS

1) **Meta**
	- `last_updated`: ISO-8601 datetime (UTC or with timezone)
	- `project_root`: repository root path
	- `language`: `uk` (default)
	- `active_skills`: list of critical skill IDs (optional)
	- `agent_notes`: 1–3 lines about environment specifics (optional). If task requires a specific git branch, record it here (e.g. "Branch: feature/xyz").

2) **Current Task**
	- `task_id`: short stable identifier (e.g. `CTX-RULES-001`)
	- `goal`: clear goal (1–2 sentences)
	- `current_focus`: specific files, methods, or lines being worked on (optional)
	- `active_files`: list of files currently open or recently edited (optional)
	- `scratchpad`: last immediate thought or intermediate state (optional)
	- `scope_in`: what is included
	- `scope_out`: what is explicitly excluded

2b) **Other Tasks (This Chat)** (optional)

If the current conversation branches into multiple tasks that are all part of the same chat, the active context may contain a short “Other Tasks” section.
Each task entry should be structured similarly to “Current Task” (task_id/goal/scope/next), but kept concise.

If “Other Tasks” exists, information in subsequent sections should be grouped by `task_id` when practical (Plan/Progress/Breadcrumbs/Guardrails/Memory Candidates) to avoid mixing unrelated state.

3) **Plan & References**
	- `plan`: reference to a plan (file or “manage_todo_list”) + short status
	- `related_docs`: list of files (if any)
	- `related_code`: list of files/folders (if code changes exist)
	- `session_history`: direct link(s) to session history file(s) relevant to the current task (see §12)

4) **Progress**
	- `done`: 2–6 bullets completed
	- `in_progress`: 1–4 bullets in progress
	- `next`: 1–6 next steps (must be actionable)

---

### 🟡 RECOMMENDED SECTIONS

5) **Breadcrumbs**
	- `last_focus`: 1–2 sentences (what you were doing when you paused)
	- `last_edit_targets`: short list of key symbols/files recently touched
	- `next_hops`: shortlist of “where to go next” (each item should say *why*)
	- `navigation_queries`: 5–10 search patterns/keywords/commands that quickly re-locate relevant code
	- `resume_recipe`: 3–6 minimal steps to regain momentum in a new session

6) **Guardrails**
	- `invariants`: 3–8 "must hold" statements (optionally with how to validate)
	- `scope_guardrails`: explicit "do not change" constraints (to prevent scope creep)
	- `risk_hotspots`: areas most likely to regress + expected failure mode
	- `temporary_allowances`: time-boxed exceptions (what, why, until when)
	- `definition_of_done`: 2–5 crisp exit criteria

---

### 🟢 OPTIONAL SECTIONS

7) **Decisions**
	- short decision log: (datetime → decision → reason)

8) **Open Questions / Blockers**

	- `last_terminal_sessions`: recent commands with exit codes
	- `preferred_tools`: which tools work best for which purposes

21) **Mental Model State** (optional)
	- `architecture_understanding`: high-level description of relevant architecture
	- `key_invariants`: rules that must always hold
	- `gotchas`: non-obvious behaviors or edge cases discovered

22) **Time & Effort Tracking** (optional)

	  depends_on: [EXPORT-FORMAT-002]
	  blocks: [UI-REFRESH-003]
	  related: [SCOPE-TRIGGER-001]
	```

25) **Quick Resume Block** (mandatory, always at the end)

	A copy-paste-ready block for instant session start without parsing the full document:

	```yaml
	# Quick Resume — <task_id>
	goal: <one sentence>
	focus_now: <what exactly we are doing>
	next_action: <concrete next step>
	key_files: [<3-5 most relevant files>]
	verify_cmd: <command to verify current state>
	last_result: success | failure | pending
	```

	This block MUST be updated at every context sync. It allows an agent to understand the task in 10 seconds.

	If multiple tasks exist in the active context, it is allowed (and recommended) to include multiple Quick Resume blocks,
	one per task, as long as they are all kept at the end of the file.

---
The content must be **necessarily sufficient** to resume work:

- Prefer *state* over history: record “what is true now” and “what to do next”.
- Avoid duplication: long logs, diffs, or exhaustive file lists should go into a session history file (see §12) or a dedicated artifact and be referenced.
- If in doubt, keep the active context readable and actionable: someone should be able to execute `next` and use `Breadcrumbs` without guessing.

## 5) When to update active context

The agent **must** synchronize `ai_memory/active_context.md`:

- After any significant plan change (added/removed steps, changed priorities).
- After any repository changes (create/edit/delete files) if they relate to the task.
- After discovering or resolving blockers.
- After clarifying requirements that change the “goal/scope”.
- After you identify new Guardrails (invariants, forbidden changes, temporary allowances, DoD).
- After you perform navigation/search work that you would want to repeat quickly (update Breadcrumbs).
- Before finishing a response, if you made a decision, changed files, or gained new important conclusions.

Minimum rule: **if a new chat might start “from zero”, update the context now.**

## 6) How to update active context (algorithm)

During synchronization:

1) Update `last_updated`.
2) Verify that `Current Task.goal` matches the actual goal of the chat.
3) Update `Plan & References`:
	- add/remove references to plan files,
	- add key files that were touched.
4) Update `Progress`:
	- move finished items to `done`,
	- reflect current state in `in_progress`,
	- write real next steps in `next`.
5) Update `Breadcrumbs` (if present):
	- keep `navigation_queries` and `resume_recipe` current,
	- update `next_hops` when priorities change.
6) Update `Guardrails` (if present):
	- add new invariants/constraints,
	- remove temporary allowances that are no longer needed.
7) If a new decision was made, add an entry to `Decisions`.
8) If there is uncertainty, add it to `Open Questions / Blockers`.
9) Update optional context sections as needed:
	- `Environment Snapshot`: after environment changes or version updates,
	- `Failure Context`: after encountering or resolving errors,
	- `Search Cache`: after productive search sessions,
	- `Code Patterns`: when establishing or applying refactoring patterns,
	- `Git State`: after commits, branch switches, or stash operations,
	- `Mental Model`: when gaining new architectural insights or discovering gotchas,
	- `Risk Register`: when identifying new risks or updating mitigation status.

Principles:

- **Necessary sufficiency over full detail.** Keep enough to resume confidently; move verbose details (logs, long file lists, code snippets) into separate files and reference them.
- **No duplication.** One fact belongs in one place (either in the context or in a referenced artifact).
- **Precise wording.** Avoid “somewhere/maybe/probably”; if unsure, it is an “Open Question”.
- **Stable identifiers.** Do not change `task_id` for minor clarifications.

## 7) Rules for multiple tasks at once

- `ai_memory/active_context.md` must have **one** primary “Current Task”.
- Additional tasks are allowed only as “Secondary Tasks” (a short list with `task_id`, `goal`, `status`, `next`).
- If focus changes, the agent must:
  - finish synchronizing the old task,
  - switch “Current Task” to the new one,
  - record the reason in `Decisions`.

### 7.0.1. Secondary Tasks format (mandatory structure)

Each secondary task MUST have the following fields:

```yaml
secondary_tasks:
  - task_id: TASK-ID-HERE
    goal: "One sentence describing the task"
    status: queued | paused | blocked
    priority: high | medium | low
    next: "1-2 immediate next steps"
    blocked_by: "<reason or task_id>" # only if status=blocked
```

**Rules:**

- **Maximum 3 secondary tasks** allowed at any time. If more are needed:
  - Archive the lowest-priority task to `ai_memory/context_history/`.
  - Register it in `contexts_index.yaml` with `status: paused`.
- **Priority definitions:**
  - `high`: Will likely become Current Task soon; keep context fresh.
  - `medium`: Important but not urgent; minimal context needed.
  - `low`: Backlog item; can be archived if slots are needed.
- **Status transitions:**
  - `queued` → `paused`: Work started but interrupted.
  - `queued` → `blocked`: Cannot proceed due to dependency.
  - Any → Current Task: Requires full context switch (§7.1).
- **Promotion to Current Task:** When a secondary task becomes the focus, execute the full switch protocol (§7.1.3).

## 7.1) Switching context when category/topic changes

This section defines a deterministic protocol for switching between task contexts when the new task belongs to a different category/topic than the current one.

### 7.1.1. Files and artifacts

- **Active context (current)**: `ai_memory/active_context.md`
- **Archived contexts (history)**: files under `ai_memory/context_history/`
- **Context registry (index)**: `ai_memory/context_history/contexts_index.yaml`

The registry is the single discoverable list of all saved contexts. It enables fast lookup and restoration without scanning file contents.

### 7.1.2. When a switch is required

Switch is required when any of these signals are true:

- The user explicitly says this is a new task/topic/category.
- The agent’s new goal/scope would contradict the current `Current Task` section.
- Work is about to move to unrelated subsystems (e.g., from element geometry refactor → export format → UI behavior) and would make the active context misleading.

If unsure, default to the simplest safe behavior:

- Ask one clarifying question, OR
- Create a new context and mark the previous one as `paused`.

### 7.1.3. Switch protocol (algorithm)

When switching from old task `A` to new task `B`:

1) **Synchronize** the current `ai_memory/active_context.md` (see §5–6).
2) **Archive** context `A`:
	- Copy the current `ai_memory/active_context.md` into `ai_memory/context_history/<ARCHIVE_FILE>.md`.
	- Append an `Archive Summary` section (mandatory) to the archived copy. It MUST be resume-oriented and include:
	  - what is true now (state),
	  - what was accomplished (high-level),
	  - where to resume (files/symbols/search queries),
	  - what is still failing/unknown (if any),
	  - a minimal resume recipe.
	- Ensure the archived copy ends with the `Quick Resume Block` (see §4.25). Since the archive is a copy of `active_context.md`, this should already be present; if not, add it.
	- Mark the archived context status as `paused` or `completed`.
3) **Register** the archived context in `ai_memory/context_history/contexts_index.yaml` (mandatory).
4) **Locate prior context for `B`**:
	- Search the registry by `task_id`, `title`, `category`, and `tags`.
	- Prefer the most recently archived context with the highest tag overlap.

Deterministic “good match” rule (to avoid guessing):

- If `task_id` matches exactly → good match.
- Else, if `category` matches AND there are at least **2** overlapping `tags` → good match.
- Else → no match; bootstrap a new context.
5) **Restore or bootstrap**:
	- If a good match is found:
		- Restore by copying that archived context into `ai_memory/active_context.md`.
		- **Git Branch Check**: If the restored context mentions a specific git branch (in `Meta` or `Git State`), check if it exists and switch to it (`git checkout`).
		- **Drift Check**: Verify `git status` and existence of `active_files`. If significant changes occurred since archiving (e.g., files deleted), record this in `Open Questions` or `Decisions`.
		- Update `last_updated`, `Current Task` (if needed), and `Decisions`.
	- If not found, bootstrap a new `ai_memory/active_context.md` using the mandatory template (§4) and reuse only stable cross-task info from relevant contexts (see next subsection).

Finally, record a `Decisions` entry explaining:

- why the switch happened,
- which context was archived,
- which one was restored/created.

### 7.1.4. Archive file naming (deterministic)

Archive file naming uses a **canonical** file per `task_id` to avoid stale duplicates.

Canonical archive file name:

- `<task_id>.md`

Optional snapshot file name (only when explicitly needed):

- `YYYY-MM-DD__<task_id>__<slug>.md`

Rules:

- By default, write/update the canonical file `ai_memory/context_history/<task_id>.md`.
- Use a dated snapshot only if you need to preserve a historical milestone (rare; not the default).
- If using a snapshot, use date in local repo time (ISO date).
- `<task_id>` must match the archived context.
- `<slug>` is optional; use only if needed to disambiguate.

### 7.1.5. Context registry format (YAML)

`ai_memory/context_history/contexts_index.yaml` MUST be YAML and MUST contain a list of entries with at least:

- `task_id` — stable id.
- `title` — human-friendly label.
- `category` — coarse category (e.g., `refactor`, `bugfix`, `docs`, `feature`).
- `tags` — list of keywords.
- `status` — `paused|completed|abandoned`.
- `archived_at` — ISO-8601 datetime.
- `file` — path to archived context file.
- `summary` — 3–10 lines (resume-oriented).

Recommended optional fields:

- `related_paths` — key folders/files.
- `restore_recipe` — 3–6 steps.
- `confidence` — `high|medium|low` for match quality (used when restoring).

Useful optional metadata (recommended when available):

- `last_restored_at` — ISO-8601 datetime.
- `repo_revision` — git commit hash if known (helps drift analysis).

### 7.1.6. Bootstrapping a new context from existing ones

If no matching context exists, create a new `ai_memory/active_context.md` (template §4) and optionally reuse only:

- **Environment Snapshot** and stable tool commands.
- **Project-wide Guardrails** that remain valid.
- **Links to shared docs** (`docs/project.md`, `docs/JS_API.md`, etc.).

Do NOT copy these across tasks (they are task-specific and go stale):

- `Progress` lists,
- task-specific `Breadcrumbs` (search queries, next hops),
- detailed failure logs.

Instead, derive fresh `Progress.next` and fresh `Breadcrumbs` for the new task.

### 7.1.7. Updating history after restoring an existing context (no stale copies)

If the active work started by restoring a context from history, avoid saving an additional outdated copy later.

Protocol:

- On restore, record where it came from (recommended): add a note in `Decisions` like:
	- `Restored from ai_memory/context_history/<task_id>.md`
- While working, keep `ai_memory/active_context.md` as the working copy.
- When switching away from this restored task (or when you want to persist progress), **overwrite** the canonical archive file:
	- `ai_memory/context_history/<task_id>.md`
- Update the matching entry in `ai_memory/context_history/contexts_index.yaml`:
	- bump `archived_at`
	- refresh `summary` and `restore_recipe`
	- set `status` (`paused|completed|abandoned`)

Default policy: **one canonical archive per task_id** (always up to date). Use dated snapshots only when explicitly requested.

## 8) Archiving and keeping context clean

- When a task is completed, the agent must:
  1) record a short summary (what was done, where, how it was verified),
  2) remove unnecessary details from active context,
  3) move long historical notes to `ai_memory/memory.md` (or another explicitly specified history file) and add a reference.

Goal: `ai_memory/active_context.md` must not become a journal; it is the “state as of now”.

## 9) Mandatory rules for artifact references

- Use **relative paths** within the repository.
- If the plan/spec is a file, it must be explicitly listed in `Plan & References`.
- If the plan is maintained via `manage_todo_list`, `Plan & References.plan` must say `manage_todo_list` + a short status.
- If the context depends on a specific command/script, add it under `Verification`.

## 10) Security and privacy

- Do not store secrets, tokens, passwords, private keys, or personal data in `active_context.md`.
- Do not paste large logs or dumps; save them into a separate file (if needed) and reference it.

## 11) Quality check before finishing a response (short checklist)

Before finishing substantial work, the agent checks:

- `ai_memory/active_context.md` is updated and `last_updated` is current.
- `goal/scope` do not contradict the real state.
- All important plan files and artifacts are listed in `Plan & References`.
- `next` contains concrete actionable steps.
- If used, `Breadcrumbs` and `Guardrails` are up to date and still reflect the intended constraints.
- New decisions and blockers are not lost.
- If a failure occurred, `Failure Context` captures the error and attempted fixes.
- If significant search/navigation was done, consider caching useful patterns in `Search Cache`.
- If new risks were identified, they are recorded in `Risk Register`.
- `Git State` reflects current branch and uncommitted changes (for multi-session work).

## 12) Session History Files

To preserve detailed session context without bloating `active_context.md`, the agent **should** maintain session history files.

### 12.1. Storage location

- Session history files are stored in `ai_memory/session_history/`.
- One file per session, named: `session_YYYY-MM-DD_NNN.md` (NNN = sequence number for that day, e.g., `session_2025-12-25_001.md`).

### 12.2. When to create and update a session file

**Creation:**
- At the **start** of a new chat session that involves non-trivial work.
- Skip for purely informational/Q&A sessions that don't change code or plans.

**Updates (incremental):**
- After **each request** that results in meaningful changes (code edits, plan updates, decisions).
- When **completing a task or milestone** — add a summary of accomplished work.
- The concept of "session end" is non-deterministic; instead, update incrementally as work progresses.

### 12.3. Session file structure (template)

The session file uses **YAML frontmatter** for machine-parseable metadata and **Markdown body** for human-readable details.

````markdown

# Session YYYY-MM-DD_NNN

## Summary

Brief overall summary of what was accomplished in this session (1-3 sentences).
Update incrementally as work progresses.

## Changelog

Chronological log of changes, grouped by time or milestone.

### HH:MM — Milestone/Action title
- **Changed**: `path/to/file.java` — brief description
- **Commit**: `abc1234` — commit message (if any)
- **Note**: additional context if needed

### HH:MM — Another action
- **Changed**: `path/to/another.md` — what was modified
- **Error**: description → **Resolution**: how it was fixed

## Notes for Next Session

- Important context that might be lost between sessions
- Partially completed work details
- Decisions pending confirmation
````

**Field descriptions:**

- `started` — session start time (ISO-8601).
- `last_updated` — last update time (update after each meaningful change).
- `task_id` — reference to Current Task from active_context.
- `status` — `in-progress` or `completed`.
- `files_changed` — count of unique files modified (for quick stats).
- `commits` — count of commits made (for quick stats).

### 12.4. Rules for session history

- **Incremental updates** — after each request that produces changes, append to `Changed Files`, `Key Actions`, or `Commits` sections.
- **Task/milestone completion** — when finishing a task or significant milestone, update `summary` and add notes to `Notes for Next Session`.
- **Reference in active_context** — the `Plan & References.session_history` field must contain direct link(s) to history file(s) relevant to the current task, with a brief note that these files contain the change history for this context.
- **No deletion** — session history files and archived contexts MUST NOT be deleted or cleaned up automatically. They serve as a permanent record for future reference and learning.
- **Privacy** — same rules as §10 — no secrets, tokens, or personal data.

## 13) Staleness detection and refresh on load

### 13.1. When to check for staleness

The agent MUST check context freshness:

- At the **start of every new chat** when loading `ai_memory/active_context.md`.
- When **restoring** an archived context from `ai_memory/context_history/`.

### 13.2. Staleness indicators

A context is considered **stale** if any of the following are true:

1. **`last_updated` age > 7 days**
   - Action: Warn; verify key files still exist.

2. **`last_updated` age > 30 days**
   - Action: Require full refresh before proceeding.

3. **`active_files` missing** (any file deleted/moved)
   - Action: Update list; note in `Decisions`.

4. **`current_branch` mismatch** (branch doesn't exist or differs)
   - Action: Ask user or switch; record in `Decisions`.

5. **`repo_revision` drift > 50 commits** behind current HEAD
   - Action: Warn; check for conflicts with `Progress`.

### 13.3. Refresh protocol

When staleness is detected:

1) **Record** the staleness in `Open Questions / Blockers` or `Decisions` (depending on severity).
2) **Verify** existence of `active_files` and `key_files` from Quick Resume Block.
3) **Check git state**: current branch, uncommitted changes, distance from archived revision.
4) **Update** stale sections:
   - Refresh `active_files` list (remove deleted, add new relevant files).
   - Update `Git State Snapshot` if present.
   - Clear or mark as "needs verification" any `Failure Context` older than the staleness threshold.
   - Review `Progress.in_progress` — items may no longer be valid.
5) **Bump** `last_updated` to current datetime.
6) **Add** a `Decisions` entry: "Context refreshed due to staleness; verified X, updated Y."

### 13.4. Lightweight vs full refresh

- **Lightweight refresh** (staleness < 30 days, no missing files) — update `last_updated`, verify `active_files`, proceed.
- **Full refresh** (staleness ≥ 30 days OR critical files missing) — re-scan related code, update `Progress`, rebuild `Breadcrumbs`, optionally ask user for confirmation before major work.
