  "task_text": "SWE1 (Sweep generator) has no connecting lead line and its sine icon changes on redraw/mouse move; Noise generator should show a static pseudo-noise graph inside a circle icon.",
  "summary": "Fixed SweepElm geometry so lead1 is not aliased to point1 (prevents lead collapsing to a dot), and removed time-based animation from the sweep icon so it stays static. Updated NoiseWaveform to render a deterministic pseudo-noise polyline inside the circle icon (hasCircle=true), so generator icons are static and noise is visually represented in-circle.",
