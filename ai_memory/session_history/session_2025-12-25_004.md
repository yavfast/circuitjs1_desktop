# Session 2025-12-25_004

## Summary
Applied soft-deprecation to legacy derived geometry fields in `CircuitElm` by adding `@Deprecated` annotations and Javadoc notes. This is a non-breaking, documentation-first step to encourage use of getters and `geom()` APIs.

## Changelog
### 14:55 — Soft deprecation
- **Changed**: `src/main/java/.../CircuitElm.java` — added `@Deprecated` and Javadoc to `dx`, `dy`, `dsign`, `dn`, `dpx1`, `dpy1` and a brief note in the class header.

## Notes for Next Session
- Continue with next batch of small refactors (gates/transistor/lines) and finish manual NW.js smoke checks when the dev env supports it.
