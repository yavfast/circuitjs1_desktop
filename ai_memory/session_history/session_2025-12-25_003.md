# Session 2025-12-25_003

## Summary
Decision: Deprecate `scripts/check_geom_usage.sh` as an active guardrail. The script is kept in the repository for reference but will no longer be recommended as part of the routine verification steps.

## Changelog
### 14:50 — Deprecation updates
- **Changed**: `scripts/check_geom_usage.sh` — added deprecation header explaining the script is retained for reference.
- **Changed**: `ai_memory/active_context.md` — removed run recommendations, updated Breadcrumbs/Guardrails to prefer manual smoke-tests and `npm run buildgwt`.
- **Changed**: `ai_memory/elm_geom_refactor_plan.md` — marked the instrumental check as DEPRECATED and recommended manual/CI checks instead.

## Notes for Next Session
- Manual NW.js smoke test still in progress (driver/shader issue blocked full testing); pick up after environment becomes usable.
