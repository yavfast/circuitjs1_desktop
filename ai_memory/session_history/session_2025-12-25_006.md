# Session 2025-12-25_006

## Summary
Reviewed next candidate set for migration: `CurrentElm`, `TransLineElm`, `CCCSElm/CCVSElm/VCCSElm`. No direct derived-field writes or endpoint write-sites found; these elements are classified as low-risk for the next migration phases.

## Notes
- No code changes required in this pass; will include these files in the validation set when executing larger batch refactors.
