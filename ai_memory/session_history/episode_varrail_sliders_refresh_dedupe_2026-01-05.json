  "summary": "Fixed slider duplication after refresh by deduping AdjustableManager.adjustables (keyed by element index + editItem + sharedSlider) before creating sliders, and by auto-adding missing VarRail voltage adjustables only at slider-creation time (after dumped adjustables have been parsed). Also removed VarRail's custom vertical-panel slider to avoid two separate slider UIs.",
